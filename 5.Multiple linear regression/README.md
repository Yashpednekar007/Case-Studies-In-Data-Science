# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.

Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.
MLR is used extensively in econometrics and financial inference.
